# PMSys (working title) 
Is a Project Management Sytem I have wanted to build for years

The aim is have this app follow the "living document" philosophy common in project managment

This means that work done in the early stages will be reusable as you progress to later stages 


Current Features:

Users can login/ register

View, Create, Edit, Delete and their own projects

Re-assign a project to another user

Designate project team members at creation as well as after the fact

Add and remove other users from the project team

Start a project plan based on labour and materials, materials list is keyed to location of the project (aka you will only be shown materials that are available in the area of your project)

Build out a proposed labour and materials list that outlines proposed total cost for the project


In Progress Features:
Gantt chart


Planned Features:

Map view of projects (polygon for footprint of construction project sites)

Material ordering using the inital planned materials & labour list which then reduced amonut left in the budget as materials and labour are issued
